I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by Professor [Sarfraz Khurshid](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~khurshid////). I received my M.S.E. from [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) (2025) and my B.S. from [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn/) (2023) in China.

My research focuses on large language models and software testing, with an emphasis on building reliable LLM-based software systems.
