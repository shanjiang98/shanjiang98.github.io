I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, where I work with Professor Sarfraz Khurshid. I previously earned my M.S.E. from UT Austin in 2025 while pursuing my Ph.D., and my B.S. from Beijing Jiaotong University in China, where I worked with Professor Ruipeng Gao.

My research interests are in large language models and software testing.
